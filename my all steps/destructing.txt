🔧 Imagine you have a box (an object):
const box = {
  apple: '🍎',
  banana: '🍌',
  orange: '🍊'
};



Now, normally, if you want to get what's inside the box, you do this:
const a = box.apple;
const b = box.banana;
const o = box.orange;
That works fine, but it’s a little repetitive. You’re writing box. again and again.

✅ Destructuring makes this easier:

const { apple, banana, orange } = box;

This does the same thing, but in a cleaner way. It says:

“Take apple, banana, and orange out of box and make variables with those names.”

Now you can use apple, banana, and orange directly in your code.
