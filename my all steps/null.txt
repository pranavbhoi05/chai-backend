The pattern of returning null in the catch block after deleting the
local file serves several important purposes in backend Cloudinary
upload operations.

 // NULL : The upload failed, so return null
        //Prevent Orphaned Files: The local file is deleted since the upload failed
        // Avoid Storage Bloat: Prevents accumulation of failed upload files on your server
