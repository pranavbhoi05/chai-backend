Multer:
        Multer is a middleware for Node.js that helps handle file uploads
         (like images, videos, PDFs) in Express.js applications.

Why Use Multer?
1. Without Multer, Express can't process file uploads easily.
2. Multer parses multipart/form-data (the format browsers use for file uploads)

Where Do Files Go?
By default, Multer saves files in a folder (e.g., uploads/).
You can customize storage (e.g., rename files, filter file types):

✔  Multer = File Upload Middleware
✔ Supports Single/Multiple Files
✔ Stores Files Locally or in Cloud (like Cloudinary)
✔ Easy Error Handling

When to Use Multer?
✅ Handling file uploads in Express/Node.js
✅ Need control over file storage location/names
✅ Processing mixed form data (files + text)
✅ Building APIs for mobile/web apps with media
