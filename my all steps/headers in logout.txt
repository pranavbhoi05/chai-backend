#req.header (or more commonly req.headers) refers to the HTTP headers sent by the client (e.g., browser or frontend app) in an HTTP request â€” like GET, POST, etc.
#Itâ€™s part of the request object in Node.js/Express (and similar frameworks), and it's how you access metadata about the request, such as:

Authorization tokens
Content types
User agents
Custom headers

ðŸ§© Why Headers Matter in Logout
1. When a user logs out from your frontend, you need to know who is logging out.
2. Butâ€¦ you can't trust the user to just send their ID in the request body (they could fake it). Instead, you rely on the Authorization header to safely identify them.

####################################################################################################

 req.header('Authorization') reads the header where the token is sent.

Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s what .header() does â€” it reads that "Authorization" part from the request.

fetch('http://localhost:5000/logout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer abc123'
  }
});

This means:

"Hey backend, I want to logout. Here's my token: abc123"

âœ… 2. Backend Reads the Token from the Header
Hereâ€™s what your Express route might look like:

app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  const authHeader = req.header('Authorization'); // <--- This is the key part
  console.log(authHeader); // Outputs: "Bearer abc123"

  // Now you can verify the token, invalidate it, etc.
  res.send('Logged out');
});


 req.header('Authorization') reads the header where the token is sent.
Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s what .header() does â€” it reads that "Authorization" part from the request.
