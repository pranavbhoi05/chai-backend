You're asking why we write this kind of code inside the route file, like:

router.route("/register").post(
  upload.fields([
    { name: "avatar", maxCount: 1 },
    { name: "coverImage", maxCount: 1 }
  ]),
  registerUser
);

✅ Why we write this in the route file:
The route file is where we:

Define the URL endpoint (like /register)

Attach the HTTP method (post, get, etc.)

Apply middlewares (like file upload, authentication, etc.)

Connect it to the controller function (registerUser)

###############################################################

So this line: 
 router.route("/register").post(
  upload.fields([
    { name: "avatar", maxCount: 1 },
    { name: "coverImage", maxCount: 1 }
  ]),
  registerUser
);

...means:
“When someone sends a POST request to /register, first handle file uploads
 using Multer, and then run the registerUser controller.”

****************************************************************************************************************************

🧠 Why we need upload.fields(...) here specifically:
You're using upload.fields(...) as a middleware to handle multipart form-data
 (file uploads). It’s important to put it before the controller so that:

*Multer parses the incoming form-data
*Files are attached to req.files
*Then your registerUser controller can use req.files.avatar, req.files.coverImage, etc.

If you don't put this middleware in the route, then:
*req.files will be undefined
*Multer won’t parse the files
*File upload will fail or be skipped


*****************************************************************************************************************

🔁 Why it's placed in this file (not controller):
We do this to keep responsibilities clean:

| Part                      | Responsibility                                |
                             
| 🛣️ Route File             | Defines the **path** and attaches middlewares |
| ⚙️ Middleware             | Handles processing like file parsing, auth    |
| 🧠 Controller             | Contains actual logic like saving to DB       |


Keeping middleware in the route file means:
*It's clear what the route expects (like files, JWT, etc.)
*You can chain multiple middlewares easily
*The controller stays clean and focused on business logic
