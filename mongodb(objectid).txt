what will i get if i write req.user._id ?
# if you go in mongodb , go in find , go in user, then u'll see string somthing like(655vf5f24etetbbgf561) but its not mongodb's id

#to get mongodb id so we needed whole ObjectId somthing like : ObjectId('561tt1g32ffttg5ggbj135v')
# but we are using mongoose , so what happens in mongoose internaly whenever we give id, it automatically behind the scene convert into mongodb object it





‚ùìCan we use:
$match: { _id: req.user._id }

instead of:
$match: { _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user._id) }

?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

‚úÖ Answer:
Yes, you can use req.user._id directly if it's already an ObjectI

‚ùå In most real-world apps:
(req.user._id) is a string, like:  "662fa389a19ecf7349b1e1fc"

#MongoDB stores _id as an ObjectId, so comparing a string to
 an ObjectId will not match, and your query will return nothing.

So this:   $match: { _id: req.user._id }  // string vs ObjectId ‚ùå
#will fail silently ‚Äî it won‚Äôt throw an error, but it won‚Äôt return any results.



‚úÖ Correct way (always works):  
$match: {
  _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user._id) // ObjectId vs ObjectId ‚úÖ
}

#This guarantees the data types match.


üîç Why it matters:
MongoDB is strict about types:

* "abc" (string) ‚â† ObjectId("abc")
#So if you're doing a $match on _id, you must be sure the type is ObjectId.


‚úÖ Final answer to remember and explain:
# "Use new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user._id) in aggregation $match to 
make sure the ID is in the correct format. If you skip it, your query 
might not work because MongoDB won't match a string with an ObjectId."
