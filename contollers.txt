1.Receive requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2.Validate input data
3.Call services/models for business logic
4.Send responses (success/error)

. What to Include in Controllers
✅ Request validation (use Joi, Zod, or custom validation)
✅ Error handling (try/catch blocks)
✅ Response formatting (consistent JSON structure)
✅ Service calls (delegate business logic to services)
✅ Status codes (proper HTTP responses)
